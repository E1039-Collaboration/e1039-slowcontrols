The H4_ldi file was created by two steps and is valid as of 24-Feb-2013.
  1. All original H4 values from when we arrived this summer are lowered 250V, EXCEPT
  2. X3T and X4B have been set by a cosmic ray trigger, reducing in 40 volt steps to find where efficiency starts to fall off.
  3. X3B has been set by balancing all outputs to give 300 counts/minute.
  4. X3T was balanced after cosmic ray trigger was used to reduce it, also to 300 counts/minute.
  5. X4B was balanced after cosmic ray trigger was used to reduce voltages to 500 counts/minute.
The ratio of cosmic rays hitting an X3 counter should be 0.6 based on the area of the counter.
Since X3B and X4T have not been adjusted by cosmic ray trigger, they will likely have to go down further.
If one simply looks at the gain of a Hamamatsu R329-02 PMT and factors in the pulse height loss due to the addition
of the clip lines, the voltages should be reduced 300 volts for a change of a factor of 10 in threshold (250 to 25 mV).
