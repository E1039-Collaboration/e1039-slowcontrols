1) HV control

We use three LeCroy 1440 HV systems: one for the Station 1 hodoscopes
H1, one for the Station 2 hodoscopes H2 and one for the Stations 3 and
4 hodoscopes H3 and H4. These HV systems can be controlled via telnet
using scripts located in "/seaquest/hodoscopes/hv". These scripts are
adopted by Josh Rubin's HV scripts.

hv is the main workhorse script, which takes two arguments.

- The first is the identifier of the station: H1, H2, H3 or H4. Please
  note that H3 and H4 refer to same HV system and thus you can control
  the Station 3 (4) hodoscopes H3 (H4) also via the identifier H4
  (H3).

- The second argument is a string which must be a LeCroy 1440 command;
e.g., "hv H3 ST" gives the status of the HV system for the Station 3
and 4 hodoscopes. 

The various scripts based on "hv" are described below.


2) Shift business

During a shift, the hodoscopes should be monitored via the scripts 
"status" and "monitor". The other scripts are considered as expert 
tools. However, when you cannot reach one of the hodoscope experts or in 
a case of emergency, please take action and turn the hodoscope off or on 
again. This can be done via the scripts "alloff" and "allon". For the 
sake of studies, you can also manipulate specific PMT via the 
set-channel script. Please coordinate this with the experts. To turn off 
an individual PMT, please set the voltage to 0. Due to the design of the 
LeCroy 1440 HV system, one can only turn off / on the whole system but 
not individual channels. Another possibility is to adjust the nominal 
settings of various PMT in
	/seaquest/hodoscopes/settings/H1
	/seaquest/hodoscopes/settings/H2
	/seaquest/hodoscopes/settings/H34
use the script set-nominal. The maximum values for H1/H2 are -1750V
and for H3/H4: X.


3) HV scripts

For the sake of completeness, all scripts are documented here (in
alphabetical order) using the Station 3 and 4 hodoscopes as example: 

alloff
	turn off all hodoscopes

allon
	turn on all hodoscopes

monitor H3
	list the set HV values and the read-out HV values

monitor-channel H3 0: 
	list these values only for channel 0

set-channel H3 0 -1500: 
	set channel 0 to the specified HV of -1500V
	maximum values for H1/H2: -1750V
	maximum values for H3/H4: X

set-nominal H3: 
	set all HV to their nominal values; 
	these values are specified in /seaquest/hodoscopes/settings/H34

set-zero H3: 
	set all HV values to zero

status H3 (an alternate version of "hv H3 ST"): 
        read-out the status
        to find out if HV is enabled and if there are channel errors

Please change into the directory /seaquest/hodoscopes/hv/ to execute
these scripts, e.g., via ./status H3 in a bash shell.  The relation
between a channel of the read-out system and a PMT, i.e. the
detectorName and elementID of a hodoscope, is given in the
	     /seaquest/hodoscopes/settings/H1
	     /seaquest/hodoscopes/settings/H2
	     /seaquest/hodoscopes/settings/H34
Please note that this information is separated from the mapping information.
